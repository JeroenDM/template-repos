# Example python data project

Small repository that plots data using python.

The actual data files are added to the .gitignore to avoid uploading large files to git.
When cloning this repository, you can get the data with the [this link](https://kuleuven.box.com/shared/static/167tetp7mejjgu99bsp1h1trxf5d49bw.txt).

Rename the downloaded file to `sample.txt`

In bash these two steps are executed as follows:

```bash
wget https://kuleuven.box.com/shared/static/167tetp7mejjgu99bsp1h1trxf5d49bw.txt
mv 167tetp7mejjgu99bsp1h1trxf5d49bw.txt sample.txt
```
